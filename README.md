Number Guessing Game :
A simple Number Guessing Game with a graphical user interface (GUI)
built using Java Swing.

Description :
The Number Guessing Game is a Java-based application that allows users 
to play a number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 
a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100), and the user has to guess the number. The 
game provides feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low. 
The user can continue guessing until they guess the correct number or run out of attempts.
The game also includes features such as the option to play multiple rounds, keeping track 
of the user's score, and resetting the game to play again.
